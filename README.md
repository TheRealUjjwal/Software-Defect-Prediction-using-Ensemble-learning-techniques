# Software-defect-prediction-using-Ensemble-Learning-techniques

*Software defect prediction using Ensemble Learning Technique is basically a machine learning approach to predict and rectify the defects in newly launched applications by providing its accuracy using various Ensemble learning techniques like Bagging, Boosting and Stacking.
*One can use these Ensemble learning methods to predict and remove the bugs and defects for smooth and efficient working of the applications.
*Its my Final Year project that was developed using a group of four peoples, each of them playing an individual role.
*My role in this project was that I worked on the Stacking and also played the role of a Team Leader.

Technologies Used: *Machine Learning
                   *Python
                   *Jupyter Notebook
                   *Numpy
